            <h2>From Air Force Base to Business Success</h2>
            <div class="about-text">
                <p><strong>Military Foundation:</strong> 22 years as an Air Force instructor pilot taught me precision under pressure and systematic evaluation of complex systems. As an instructor pilot for 20 years, I specialized in evaluating performance, identifying improvement opportunities, giving constructive feedback, and teaching others to excel. These same skills now drive my approach to business automation.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Business Portfolio:</strong> Over 21 years, I've owned and operated 5 successful businesses while helping create 5 additional businesses with their owners. My businesses range from paper-intensive, telephone-driven operations with zero automation to completely digital ventures built from blank-slate concepts. Combined, these 10 businesses have earned over 2,500 five-star Google reviews.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Teaching Excellence:</strong> 20 years as an instructor pilot, plus 7 years teaching college and 2 years in high school, have honed my ability to evaluate systems, identify inefficiencies, provide actionable feedback, and teach implementation strategies. I approach business automation the same way I approached flight training‚Äîsystematic, precise, and focused on real-world results.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Transformation Specialist:</strong> I've guided businesses through complete transformations‚Äîfrom paper-driven chaos to streamlined digital operations. Some started with zero computerization; others I built from pure concepts. The common thread? Every successful transformation followed the same systematic approach I learned in military training and perfected through decades of teaching.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Proven Results:</strong> 2,500+ five-star reviews across 10 businesses aren't just numbers‚Äîthey represent thousands of customers who experienced the efficiency and reliability that comes from properly implemented systems. When you work with <span class="microoffice-automation">MicroOffice Automation</span>, you're getting strategies proven across diverse industries and business models.</p>
