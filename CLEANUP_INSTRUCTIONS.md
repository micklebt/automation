# Cleanup Instructions

After verifying that all images are properly moved and working in their new locations, remove these directories:

1. microofficeautomation/images/
2. mickleyofficeautomation/images/
3. brianmickleyautomation/images/

## Pre-Cleanup Checklist
- [x] All images moved to assets/images structure
- [x] HTML paths updated to new locations
- [x] Favicon structure documented
- [x] Backup of original files exists in archives_backup_files

## Post-Cleanup Verification
1. Load each site's index.html
2. Verify all images load correctly
3. Check favicon implementation
4. Test responsive behavior
5. Validate HTML paths

## Directory Structure After Cleanup
Each site should have this structure:
```
site_name/
├── assets/
│   └── images/
│       ├── animations/
│       ├── content/
│       └── icons/
├── favicon.ico
└── index.html
```

## Next Steps
1. Generate favicons from profile photo
2. Test all sites locally
3. Deploy to production
4. Verify live sites
